# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Lesson index lists each lesson once. Proposed and retired lessons share one directory; scanning it twice had duplicated every entry in `INDEX.yaml`.
- `snowbot lesson accept` (and `promote`) refuses a lesson when an evidence ref is not an existing project file, a pull request present in git history or on GitHub, or the id of a recorded stop event. Lessons are found by id even when the YAML filename differs.
- `snowbot playbook` omits accepted lessons that recommend an action forbidden by AGENTS.md safety rules.

### Added

- **Architect gate CI** (`.github/workflows/architect-gate.yml`): required check `architect-gate` runs independent validation (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `snowbot validate`, memory status); optional PR summary comment (not an approval). Emergency label `skip-architect`.
- Senior Software Architect role template (`src/snowbot/templates/roles/architect.md.j2`) and docs: `docs/ARCHITECT_GATE.md`, `docs/GITHUB_SETUP.md` (simple mode: 0 approvals, CI validator).
- Phase 1b: phase validator (`snowbot validate --phase 1b`), string phase ids (`1`, `1b`, `2`, …), shared lessons memory, anti-gaming diff checks, independent validation script/docs, governance CODEOWNERS, and `snowbot status --check`.
- Governance docs (#7): owner ruleset and dependency graph steps; expanded `docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` with exact required check names and owner-only settings.
- Phase 1 scaffold: `snowbot` Typer CLI (`doctor`, stub `init`/`run`/`update`), Pydantic v2 models for `snowbot.yaml`, pipeline spec, and backlog.
- Structured errors, logging with secret redaction, pytest suite mirroring `src/snowbot/`.
- `pyproject.toml`, pre-commit, CI (ruff, mypy, pytest 85% coverage), security and PR title workflows.
- Repository metadata: CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, AGENTS.md, ADRs, branch protection docs/script, GitHub templates, Dependabot, CODEOWNERS.
- Example root `snowbot.yaml`, `docs/pipeline-spec.yaml`, and `docs/backlog.yaml`.

### Changed

- `.github/CODEOWNERS`: restore Phase 1b governance paths (workflows, packaging, validator, contributor docs).
- CI: skip conventional-commit PR title check for Dependabot actors; `dependency-review` continues on error until Dependency graph is enabled.
