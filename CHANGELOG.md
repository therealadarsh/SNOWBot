## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Research harness (`research/`): study-task fixtures, condition arms A0–A4, an independent path/pattern outcome oracle, a cell runner with budget and sandbox boundaries, a hashed manifest, and extract tables. No model provider is called. The pilot matrix is configuration only.
- **Architect gate CI** (`.github/workflows/architect-gate.yml`): required check `architect-gate` runs independent validation (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `snowbot validate`, memory status); optional PR summary comment (not an approval). Emergency label `skip-architect`.
- Senior Software Architect role template (`src/snowbot/templates/roles/architect.md.j2`) and docs: `docs/ARCHITECT_GATE.md`, `docs/GITHUB_SETUP.md` (simple mode: 0 approvals, CI validator).
- Phase 1b: phase validator (`snowbot validate --phase 1b`), string phase ids (`1`, `1b`, `2`, …), shared lessons memory, anti-gaming diff checks, independent validation script/docs, governance CODEOWNERS, and `snowbot status --check`.
- Governance docs (#7): owner ruleset and dependency graph steps; expanded `docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` with exact required check names and owner-only settings.
- Phase 1 scaffold: `snowbot` Typer CLI (`doctor`, stub `init`/`run`/`update`), Pydantic v2 models for `snowbot.yaml`, pipeline spec, and backlog.
- Structured errors, logging with secret redaction, pytest suite mirroring `src/snowbot/`.
- `pyproject.toml`, pre-commit, CI (ruff, mypy, pytest 85% coverage), security and PR title workflows.
- Repository metadata: CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, AGENTS.md, ADRs, branch protection docs/script, GitHub templates, Dependabot, CODEOWNERS.
- Example root `snowbot.yaml`, `docs/pipeline-spec.yaml`, and `docs/backlog.yaml`.

### Changed

- `.github/CODEOWNERS`: restore Phase 1b governance paths (workflows, packaging, validator, contributor docs).
- CI: skip conventional-commit PR title check for Dependabot actors; `dependency-review` continues on error until Dependency graph is enabled.
